# ProLeague
This repository is for my project where I have taken CSV files from the Oracle Elixir website which contains information from professional League of Legends games taken from the official Riot Games API. 

I am going to use Python to store, post process the data and potentially look to create a cross platform app (iOS and Android) using React Native or a website. This would be so that I get experience in learning how to do full stack development, management of a database and creation + deployment of a working app.
